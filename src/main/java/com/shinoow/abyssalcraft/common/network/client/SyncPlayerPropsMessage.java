/**
 * 
 * A packet to send ALL data stored in your extended properties to the client.
 * This is handy if you only need to send your data once per game session or
 * all of your data needs to be synchronized together; it's also handy while
 * first starting, since you only need one packet for everything - however,
 * you should NOT use such a packet in your final product!!!
 * 
 * Each packet should handle one thing and one thing only, in order to minimize
 * network traffic as much as possible. There is no point sending 20+ fields'
 * worth of data when you just need the current mana amount; conversely, it's
 * foolish to send 20 packets for all the data when the player first loads, when
 * you could send it all in one single packet.
 * 
 * TL;DR - make separate packets for each piece of data, and one big packet for
 * those times when you need to send everything.
