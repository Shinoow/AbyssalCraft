message.jzahar.death.1=Congratulations, you "killed" me. No, not even close. You CAN'T kill a Great Old One.
message.jzahar.death.2=What you killed is a simuraculum (a mere physical incarnation of infinite darkness). Some call it a puppet.
message.jzahar.death.3=Something that escapes a human when they delve into madness is the concept of reality.

necronomicon.text.necronomicon.2=The Necronomicon itself is a chapter of the Abyssalnomicon, which was read to Alhazred by a demon known as J'zahar, who had composed the Abyssalnomicon from infinite knowledge known to The Great Old Ones.
necronomicon.text.necronomicon.3=There are 4 types of Necronomicons within the Abyssalnomicon: The Necronomicon, The Abyssal Wasteland Necronomicon, The Dreadlands Necronomicon and The Omothol Necronomicon, each with knowledge bound to a specific dimension.
necronomicon.text.necronomicon.4=In order to unlock the knowledge, one must travel to said dimension and empower the Necronomicon with the flesh of that world. The Abyssalnomicon contains additional knowledge known only to J'zahar, knowledge man was not meant to obtain.

necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon.1=This is the Abyssalnomicon, a book written by J'zahar, Gatekeeper of The Abyss. The book contains the knowledge of the 4 Necronomicons, as they are in fact chapters of this book. There is also extensive knowledge not mentioned in the others.
necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon.2=As the knowledge about spells and rituals is limited to the specified dimension (and previous ones, depending on the Necronomicon type), the Abyssalnomcion has all knowledge collected in one place, with additions.

necronomicon.text.abyssalcraft.1=AbyssalCraft is the mod which this book is used to guide you through. It's mainly focused on exploration, with 4 new dimensions you can explore.
necronomicon.text.abyssalcraft.2=The dimensions are reached through the use of "Gateway Keys", which are keys designed to create portals between dimensions (the 4th dimension is reached by falling out of the 3rd).
necronomicon.text.abyssalcraft.3=The Overworld has been expanded with 6 new biomes: the Darklands (normal, plains, forest, highlands, mountain) and the Coralium Infested Swamp.
necronomicon.text.abyssalcraft.4=There's also 5 new types of stone and 15 new ores found throughout the Overworld and the dimensions.

necronomicon.text.yog-sothoth.1=Yog-Sothoth, The Lurker at the Threshold, is an Outer God, and the offspring of the Nameless Mist.
necronomicon.text.yog-sothoth.2=It is heavily implied, if not outright stated, that Yog-Sothoth is omniscient, and is locked outside the universe, meaning he knows and can see all of space-time all at once, that there is no secret hidden from Yog-Sothoth.
necronomicon.text.shub-niggurath.1=Shub-Niggurath, The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young, is an Outer God in the pantheon.
necronomicon.text.shub-niggurath.2=She is a perverse fertility deity, said to appear as an enormous cloudy mass which extrudes black tentacles, slime-dripping mouths, and short, writhing goat legs. Small creatures are continually spat forth by the monstrosity, which are reconsumed or escape
necronomicon.text.cthulhu.1=Cthulhu is a Great Old One, trapped in an endless sleep underneath the sea in the city R'lyeh.
necronomicon.text.cthulhu.2=He has the head of an octopus, and a scaly body with wings on his back. His state of endless sleep comes from a war against the Elder Beings, which ended with R'lyeh sinking to the bottom of the sea. One day he will rise to rule over the earth.
necronomicon.text.hastur.1=Hastur, The Unspeakable, is a Great Old One and Cthulhu's half-brother.
necronomicon.text.hastur.2=Not much is known about Hastur, but he is known to take the form of a king in yellow robes, wearing a mask. Like most Great Old Ones, he is capable of taking any form he desires.
necronomicon.text.jzahar.1=J'zahar, Gatekeeper of The Abyss, is the bastard offspring of Hastur.
necronomicon.text.jzahar.2=Having a desire for power, and not wanting exile to the stars, J'zahar reached out beyond time and space to achieve his freedom. The results were similar powers to that of Yog-Sothoth, and the punishment of eternally guarding his imprisoned fellow deities.

necronomicon.text.greatoldones=Before the ages of man, the universe was ruled by a race of ancient demonic gods known as "The Great Old ones". Due to a conflict aeons ago, all of these beings are imprisoned far away where no man has ever set foot.
necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon_info=The Abyssalnomicon is the unholy tome from which the Necronomicon was written, when J'zahar read that section to Alhazred.

necronomicon.text.overworld=The Overworld has been expanded in new biomes to discover, among them the Darklands biomes and the Coralium Infested Swamp. You may also encounter Depths Ghouls and Abyssal Zombies during your travels, who enter the overworld through the Abyssal Wasteland.
necronomicon.text.abyssal=This is the first layer of the Abyss, a place that's dark, green, and populated by the undead. Oblivionaire is said to be the one watching over this place, or his dragon, Asorah. Likely where Coralium originates from.
necronomicon.text.dreadlands=Previously a world of Abyssalnite, the Dreadlands got it's name when the Dread Plague was unleashed on it, killing all miners and corrupting the peaceful Abyssalnite Golems. The second layer of the Abyss holds lost souls of the living.
necronomicon.text.omothol=An endless temple city built at the very edge of sanity. The Realm of J'zahar holds the only entrance to where The Great Old Ones dwell. The Gatekeeper is always watching, and nobody leaves the final layer of the Abyss alive.
necronomicon.text.darkrealm=Beneath Omothol lies the realm where the immortal souls of evil demonic gods rest, awaiting their reincarnation. The Dark Realm is where living shadows are born, and the last place a living souls should ever visit, as they will face eternal suffering.

necronomicon.text.materials.nitre.1=Nitre is a new ore found randomly in the Overworld. It can be used to create gunpowder, but doesn't have that many uses past that. It can be crystallized into Potassium and Nitrate crystals.
necronomicon.text.materials.liquidantimatter.1=Liquid Antimatter is a new liquid found underground in Coralium Infested Swamps. It has the ability to de-materialize entities, and can also force other liquids to solidify upon collision.
necronomicon.text.materials.liquidantimatter.2=If you happen to fall into a pool of Liquid Antimatter, you will likely die within approximately 5 seconds, as it deals a large amount of damage in a very short time, making it quite hard to avoid certain death when getting in contact with it.
necronomicon.text.materials.abyssalstone.1=Abyssal Stone is a new type of stone that the Abyssal Wasteland is made out of. You need iron tools or better to break it. Compared to other stone types, it is resistant to the transmutation produced by Liquid Coralium, and it can be turned into Abyssal Stone Bricks. Drops Abyssal Cobblestone when mined.

necronomicon.text.materials.abyssalcoralium.1=Abyssal Coralium is a variant of Coralium found within the Abyssal Wasteland. It is almost identical to it's overworld counterpart. Much like the regular Coralium Ore, the Abyssal Coralium Ore drops Coralium Gems, which has multiple uses. Generates around Y = 55 and below.
necronomicon.text.materials.liquifiedcoralium.1=Liquified Coralium is a variant of Coralium found within the Abyssal Wasteland. Compared to the other variants, it doesn't drop Coralium Gems when mined. When mined, the dropped ore can be smelted down for Refined Coralium Ingots. Generates around Y = 22 and below.
necronomicon.text.materials.pearlescentcoralium.1=Pearlescent Coralium is a variant of Coralium found within the Abyssal Wasteland. This variant drops Coralium Pearls when mined, instead of Coralium Gems. Due to the item gained from the ore, it is quite rare, and generates around Y = 10 and below.
necronomicon.text.materials.liquidcoralium.1=Liquid Coralium is a new liquid found within the Abyssal Wasteland. It has the ability to transmute elements on contact, as in converting any water-based liquid into itself, and most stone types into Abyssal Stone.
necronomicon.text.materials.liquidcoralium.2=It also infects entities that touches it with the Coralium Plague, killing them if they aren't immune. Some entities can be converted into Abyssal Zombies on death. If the liquid collides with Liquid Antimatter, it will convert into Coralium Stone.
necronomicon.text.materials.powerstonedreadlands.1=Dreadlands Infused Powerstone is a special stone found deep within Abyssal Strongholds. You need a pickaxe stronger or equal to a Refined Coralium Pickaxe in order to mine it. Once mined, it can be used to upgrade your Gateway Key if you have the other components.

necronomicon.text.materials.abyssalnitestone.1=Abyssalnite Stone is a stone found within the Purified Dreadlands biome inside the Dreadlands. You can turn it into Abyssalnite Stone Bricks.
necronomicon.text.materials.abyssalnitestone.2=This was formerly what the Dreadlands was made out of before it became the Dreadlands, since the dimension was once a gigantic mine hosting the largest amount of pure Abyssalnite.
necronomicon.text.materials.dreadlandsabyssalnite.1=Dreadlands Abyssalnite is a variant of Abyssalnite found in the Dreadlands. The ore gained from mining it can be smelted for Abyssalnite Ingots. Ironically enough, based on the conditions where this ore exist, this is the purest form of Abyssalnite Ore found anywhere.
necronomicon.text.materials.dreadedabyssalnite.1=Dreaded Abyssalnite is a variant of Abyssalnite found in the Dreadlands. The ore gained from mining it can be smelted for Abyssalnite Ingots.

necronomicon.text.materials.ethaxium.1=Ethaxium is a new material most commonly appearing in Omothol as the material used for structures built there. Ethaxium is extremely hard, and can thus only be destroyed with tools made from it.
necronomicon.text.materials.ethaxium.2=Ethaxium is said to be what souls are made out of, which likely explains why it's almost indestructible. No wonder J'zahar built his temple city from this.
necronomicon.text.materials.darkethaxium.1=Dark Ethaxium is a stronger version of Ethaxium created by combining regular Ethaxium with Omothol Stone. This kind of Ethaxium is harder than it's normal counterpart. This material is only used in one structure, the Temple of J'zahar.
necronomicon.text.materials.ritualaltar.1=The Ritual Altar is the main component in performing rituals.

When the ritual starts, the target animal will begin to emit smoke particles, and needs to die before the ritual ends. Failing to complete a ritual will trigger a Disruption, which is bad.

necronomicon.text.pe.1=Potential Energy (PE) is a new form of energy presented in AbyssalCraft. It originates from a higher plane of existence (where no mortal has wandered), and can only be collected by tapping into Ley Lines using various methods. There exist objects capable of doing so, which will be explained here.
necronomicon.text.pe.2=A good place to start obtaining materials required to create some of the PE collecting objects is Shoggoth Lairs, found in swamps and rivers.
necronomicon.text.pe.3=Shoggoth Monoliths are also constructed with Monolith Stone (hence the name), while having statues placed on them. These statues can collect PE.
necronomicon.text.pe.4=It should be noted that the Lesser Shoggoths only build these monoliths under certain conditions. Theorists claim it has to do with power positions (but they're genderless, and don't understand the concept of hieracrchy). If 6 (or more) Lesser Shoggoths are within 32 blocks of each other, one is prone to rise a monolith out of the ooze.
necronomicon.text.pe.5=You should take into account that the Lesser Shoggoths have no limit on how many monoliths they construct, leading to a possible infestation.
necronomicon.text.pe.6=If you notice Shoggoth activity near your homestead, it is highly advised that you immediately evacuate your land, or construct a large wall (or other defensive measures) to ensure the infestation doesn't spread onto your land. Recovering your land from a Shoggoth infestation is quite difficult, so be cautious.
necronomicon.text.pe.7=The statues come in different shapes, all depicting Great Old Ones. They can transport PE to nearby players holding Necronomicons when under open sky.
necronomicon.text.pe.8=It should be noted that you harvesting PE isn't appreciated. This causes disruptions to occur (displayed by a bolt of lightning striking the statue, or other PE manipulator). Disruptions are random events that can affect the player, other entities or the environment. Their purpose is to punish those who tries to drain PE from the higher plane.
necronomicon.text.pe.9=Statues have a limited PE transfer range to nearby collectors. Collectors need to be placed in the yellow frame (with a two block gap between it and the statue).
necronomicon.text.pe.10=When placed on Monolith Stone Pillar Blocks, the statues range can be increased up to two blocks. Statues on pillars can transfer energy to Collectors further down.
necronomicon.text.pe.11=An Energy Depositioner is another PE manipulator. It works like a generator, where the "fuel" are Stone Tablets charged with PE.
necronomicon.text.pe.12=One way to boost the efficiency of statues (and other PE manipulators) is through the use of Ritual Charms. They can boost various stats (check the tooltip).
necronomicon.text.pe.13=You can also craft an Energy Pedestal, which can collect PE from statues (and other PE manipulators). Items that can hold PE can be placed on the pedestal to charge.
necronomicon.text.pe.14=Along with the Energy Pedestal there's the Sacrificial Altar, which can convert life-force from dying entities into PE (targeted entities emit smoke).
necronomicon.text.pe.15=Another way to collect PE from manipulators is with an Energy Collector. It works like an Energy Pedestal (except you can't place items on it).
necronomicon.text.pe.16=Energy Relays are used to transfer PE, and can do so in any direction (but it can't transport it through solid blocks, except glass).
necronomicon.text.pe.17=Building networks with Energy Relays allows you to transport PE over larger distances. Energy Relays can drain PE from PE Collector placed next to it.
necronomicon.text.pe.18=In order to store greater amounts of PE, you can create an Energy Container. They allow insertion through Energy Relays or interaction with the block.
necronomicon.text.pe.19=If the PE production still is too slow, you can also upgrade the various PE handling blocks through infusion rituals to boost stats.
necronomicon.text.pe.20=Upon reaching Omothol, you will be able to create deity-specific Ritual Charms (with an Abyssalnomicon), or buy them from Remnant Priests. Those charms will give an additional boost if used on manipulators associated with the same deity as the one displayed on the charm.

necronomicon.text.machines.info=Check the information section for information regarding the different machines, or the other sections for all recipes for the specified machine. The recipes aren't sorted in any way.

necronomicon.text.machines.1=The Transmutator is used to transmute objects into other objects, which can revert a process or simply convert an object into it's opposite. It's fueled by any Coralium materials, Coralium-plagued Flesh and any Crystallized element (full crystal or shard).
necronomicon.text.machines.2=The Crystallizer is used to crystallize elements, isolating the base elements (or molecules) they're made from. It's fueled by any Dreaded material, Dread Fragments and any Crystallized element (full crystal or shard).
necronomicon.text.machines.3=The Engraver is used to engrave coins, allowing you to trade things with Remnant. The "fuel" used in engraving is engraving templates, that wear out after a certain amount of uses. If you want to re-engrave a coin, you have to use a blank engraving on it first (to un-engrave it).
necronomicon.text.machines.4=The Materializer is used to create objects by combining base elements (obtained through crystallization). The Materializer uses no fuel, but requires a Necronomicon to function, and a Crystal Bag with crystals to materialize objects from.

necronomicon.text.knowledge.1=Some information in this book is incomprehensible to your puny, regular, untwisted mortal mind. By studying artifacts, listening to the whispers from statues, defeat monsters and explore the surroundings, you can expand your mind with new knowledge, enabling you to comprehend the information. Some Items and Blocks also require knowledge in order to be comprehended.
necronomicon.text.knowledge.2=Treasure chests can contain lost pages with information, and in old structures scattered about, you can uncover murals that will grant you knowledge. Statues depicting Great Old Ones can sometimes be heard whispering things. Through combat you can gain knowledge of the enemy after defeating it. Exploring biomes and dimensions will grant you new knowledge.
necronomicon.text.knowledge.3=Information you can't comprehend appears in Aklo glyphs rather than the human alphabet. The following page has an example of such glyphs:

necronomicon.text.coraliumplague.1=The Coralium Plague is a disease originating from the Abyssal Wasteland. It's capable of transforming infected victims on death into stronger monsters. It's only considered a plague by those harmed by it.
necronomicon.text.coraliumplague.2=An antidote for the Coralium Plague can be made with a Water Bottle, a Wasteland's Thorn, a piece of Anti-Plagued Flesh and a piece of Abyssal Shoggoth Flesh.

necronomicon.text.dreadplague.1=The Dread Plague is a disease originating from the Dreadlands. It's a very infectious disease, swiftly travelling between hosts, but also transforming the ground around those afflicted by it, thus allowing the plague to grow stronger. The only place known to be completely immune to the Dread Plague is Omothol.
necronomicon.text.dreadplague.2=An antidote for the Dread Plague can be made with a Water Bottle, a Dreadlands Sapling, a Dread Fragment and a piece of Dreaded Shoggoth Flesh.

necronomicon.text.wip=This section is incomplete.
