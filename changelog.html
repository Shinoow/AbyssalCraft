<ul>
	<li>Energy Container/Pedestal/Collector/Relay and Sacrificial Altars now behave as Items capable of holding PE in Item form (instead of only displaying the amount of energy contained)</li>
	<li>However, they don't transfer/receive PE externally, so rituals won't drain from them, nor will statues charge them while in your hand or on the ground</li>
	<li>The Dreadium Katana can now be enchanted properly on an enchanting table</li>
	<li>Added Cha'rcoal (like Charcoal, except something's off about it...)</li>
	<li>Added configurable plague immunities (you can make mobs from other mods immune and or carriers of the Coralium and Dread Plagues)</li>
	<li>Added a secondary Darklands Oak Wood Block, which has the blinking spots</li>
	<li>Re-added Inventory Tweaks support for Crystal Bags</li>
	<li>Added a config option that toggles whether or not J'zahar can break the fourth wall</li>
	<li>Added a config option that toggles whether or not Lesser Shoggoths are immune to projectile damage</li>
	<li>The "Liquid Coralium transmutation" config option now also controls whether or not Liquid Coralium can transmute non-fluid blocks into their Abyssal Wasteland counterparts</li>
